# Internet Connection Status Checker 🌐

This is a simple web page that checks the internet connection status and dynamically updates the background color of the page based on the status. When the internet connection is available, the background color is light green, and when it's not available, the background color is light red.

## Features

✅ Automatically checks internet connection status on page load.
✅ Updates the background color dynamically based on the connection status.
✅ Provides a "Refresh Status" button for manual status updates.
✅ Smooth transition effect for background color changes.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The internet connection status will be displayed, and the background color will indicate the status (green for connected, red for disconnected).
3. Click the "Refresh Status" button to manually update the status if needed.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works

The JavaScript code listens for online and offline events to detect changes in the internet connection status. When the status changes, it updates the text content and background color of the page accordingly. Additionally, users can manually refresh the status by clicking the provided button.
