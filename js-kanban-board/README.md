Kanban Board 📋
This is a simple Kanban Board web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage tasks across three columns: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed."

Click the "✅ Completed" button to move a task from either the "To Do" or "In Progress" column to the "Completed" column.
